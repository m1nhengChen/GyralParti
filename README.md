1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/subnetwork-partitioning.git
   cd src
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```
3. **Run our code:**
   ```bash
   python subnet_partition.py
   ```
 **Note:**  The Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset is **restricted-access** due to its licensing and data usage agreements. Therefore, we cannot include or distribute it within this repository. 

If you wish to use the HCP dataset for your research or analyses:
1. Please **request access** through the [official HCP website](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult).
2. Once access is granted, follow their guidelines to **download** the dataset.
3. Place the downloaded data into the appropriate directory (e.g., `data/HCP/`) to integrate it with the scripts and notebooks in this repository.

## Additional Benchmark Implementations

In addition to the methods described in the paper, we also provide code implementations for two additional benchmarks:

1. **K-means**  
   A simple yet effective clustering method widely used in various fields. local Lloyd algorithm with the k-means++ seeding strategy are adopted in this implementation. 
```bash
  python kmeans++.py
  ```

2. **k-means(DeepWalk)**  
   A na√Øve strategy of concatenating node attributes to learned node embeddings of the graph without attributes.
```bash
  python deep_walk_kmeans.py
  ```
